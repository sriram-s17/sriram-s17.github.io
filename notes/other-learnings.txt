origin - specifies scheme or protocol(http), domain and port
security on the web:
    same origin policy:
        - cross origin embedding(image, video, iframe,etc.) writes(llinks, redirects and form submissions) allowed
        - but cross origin read is not allowed but leaked by embedding
        to allow cross origin, we can use CORS(cross origin resource sharing) headers in http headers which is configured in server to allow cross origin

API:
    a interface to offers services of a software to other software
    simply defines, it is used to interact with softwares by other softwares

Web APIs:
    it is collection of APIs in browsers
    web browser api is lowest one and DOM API is the higher level one
    most APIs, including DOM API is written in javascript based on W3C specifications by browsers
    the DOM API contains the interfaces which in turn contains methods and properties

DOM(Document Object Model)
    DOM is built in web browsers not javascript

    It is a tree structure representation of HTML or XML documents. it is also called as data representation of objects where each object is a part of a document
    That tree structure is called DOM tree. 
    
    Nodes and objects:
        the tree have branches. each branches ends with a node. each node contains object.
        In technical we say, the DOM tree contains nodes and a node contain single object.

    DOM is used as a interface to interact with the web page by javascript or other programming languages
    DOM API provides methods and properties to access the objects to change its content, style, structure, etc.

    intro to DOM interface:
        DOM contain many interfaces. the interface provides methods and properties and also many interfaces inherits others interfaces
        In general in java, an interface is collection of properties and methods declaration which is implmented in class
    
    As DOM contains objects, each is a different type like document, node, element, attr, etc. which all are called interfaces.
    and so the object is a instance of interface

DOM interfaces:

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

    document object - first object in web page content
    Document interface - provides methods and properties for the document object that is the entire page
    node - every object in a document is node like element, attribute, content and eventlisteners

    inheritance order of interfaces:
        EventTarget (used for eventlisteners, etc)
            |   |
            |   |> Window (innerwidth height of windows)
            |
            |> Node (manages child,textContent, etc )
                |    |
                |    |> Document (querySelector, createElement, etc.)
                |
                |> Element (children, innerHTML, etc.)
                    |
                    |> HTMLElement (HTMLImageElement, HTMLButtonElement, etc.)
